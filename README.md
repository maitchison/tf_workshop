# An Introduction to TensorFlow

Build a convolutional neural network to identify hand written digits.

## Requirements

The easiest way to get all the requirements is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) which is a collection of data science tools.  These workbooks assume you are using the Python 3.6 version (but 2.7 should work too).

You will then need to install the following additional packages:

**Jupyter notebook**

This comes installed with Anaconda.  

See http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html if you want to install it manually.

**Tensorflow**:

\>\> pip install tensorflow

See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for alternative options.

## Further Reading

There are a lot of great machine learning resources on the internet.

The TensorFlow website has lots of good [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/), including this one on [image recognition](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition).

Stanfords CNN [course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is difficult, but excellent, and totally free!  Including all the lecture [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
